# WeatherApp-Android
Overview:
This project is an Android weather application developed in Java using Android Studio. It utilizes the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve weather data and provides users with real-time weather information for a given location. The app allows users to search for specific cities and displays the current weather conditions along with the forecast for the upcoming days.

Features:

Current Weather Display: The app displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Forecast Display: Users can view the weather forecast for the upcoming days, including temperature and weather conditions.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific cities to get weather information for those locations.
Location-based Weather: The app can also retrieve weather data based on the user's current location using the device's GPS or network.
Unit Selection: Users can choose between different units of measurement, such as Celsius or Fahrenheit, for displaying temperature.
Error Handling: The app handles errors gracefully, displaying appropriate messages when there are network issues or invalid search queries.
Technologies and APIs Used:

Java: The primary programming language used for Android app development.
Android Studio: The integrated development environment (IDE) for building Android applications.
OpenWeatherAPI: An API that provides access to weather data, including current weather and forecasts, for various locations worldwide.
Google Play Services: Used to access the device's GPS or network for location-based weather data.
Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for Android used to make API requests and handle responses.
JSON: The weather data retrieved from the OpenWeatherAPI is in JSON format, and parsing techniques are used to extract relevant information.
Setup and Installation:

Clone the repository or download the project source code.
Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."
